# Portfolio Einzahlungs-Heatmap

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **Portfolio Einzahlungs-Heatmap** is a powerful and intuitive React application designed to help you visualize and analyze your monthly portfolio deposits. By simply uploading CSV export files from your portfolio management software (like Portfolio Performance), you can generate a detailed heatmap and interactive line charts that reveal your deposit trends over time. Understand your average deposits per year, month, and observe chronological flows at a glance.
